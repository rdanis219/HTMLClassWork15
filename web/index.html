    <h2>The Halloween Store</h2>
    <h3> <b>For the little Goblin in all of us</b></h3>
    <h2>Welcome to my site.  Please come in and stay awhile</h2>
        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
        holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
        Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
        
        <p> If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite
            Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email
            list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
